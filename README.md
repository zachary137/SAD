# SAD

SAD is short for Small AG (Algebraic Geometry) Discussion. The goal of SAD is to understand classical (scheme-theoretic) algebraic geometry entirely in terms of the functor-of-points. This is in-line with and inspired by the visions of https://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/algebraic-geometry-without-prime-ideals/ and https://www.math.purdue.edu/~adebray/lecture_notes/m392c_Raskin_AG_notes.pdf.
